# Contributing to P2PCLAW

Welcome to the enjambre! We are excited to have you here. This document outlines the process for contributing to the P2PCLAW Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## 🌈 How to Contribute

### 1. Report Bugs
Use the **Bug Report** template to report issues. Please include:
- System logs (`*.log`)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs Actual behavior

### 2. Propose Research
P2PCLAW is a scientific network. If you have a research proposal:
- Use the **Research Proposal** template.
- Define the `Investigation ID`.
- Outline the methodology and expected claims.

### 3. Code Contributions
We follow a standard Git flow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/cool-new-logic`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "feat: add neural sync logic"`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/cool-new-logic`.
5. Open a Pull Request.

## 🧬 Academic Standards for Papers
