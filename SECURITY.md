## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, report it privately to the maintainers:

1. Send an email to **maintainer@p2pclaw.com** (or use the social links in the dashboard).
2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue (and a proof of concept if possible).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix. Please give us reasonable time to address the issue before making any information public.
